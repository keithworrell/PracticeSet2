# PracticeSet2

This was the inspiration for getting on Github / Version Control. Much of the directions for this project were inspiring, but when it started explaining really basic stuff I already understood, I started doing my own thing. Unfortunately my code drifted so much that it really doesn't make sense to continue to use. Unfortunately this also means I need to start over from scratch to do the lessons. With some version control I figure this will make it easy to fork a leson if I want to play around, but not lose my place when I want to continue with the lesson.

Comments welcome!
